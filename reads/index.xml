      <description>Microservice Architecture at Medium (medium.engineering)
 At Medium, our technical stack started with a monolithic Node.js app back in 2012. We have built a couple of satellite services, but we haven’t created a strategy to adopt the microservice architecture systematically. As the system becomes more complex and the team grows, we moved to a microservice architecture in early 2018. In this post, we want to share our experiences of doing it effectively and avoiding microservice syndromes.</description>

      <description>This Is Silicon Valley (onezero.medium.com)
 Everyone wears Patagonia and North Face, everyone has AirPods hanging from their ears, and everyone goes to Lake Tahoe on weekends. And everyone talks about the same things: startups, blockchain, machine learning, and startups with blockchain and machine learning.
As Jeffrey Hammerbacher, a former Facebook executive, told Bloomberg, “The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.”
 The Silicon Valley author described is exactly what I see in the Silivon Valley.</description>

      <description>UTC is Enough for Everyone, Right? (zachholman.com)
 It turns out humans have had a long, long history of poorly dealing with time, so when you hammer your head against the wall trying to deal with a timezone bug, well, you’re just the last in a long, long line of human beings that are terrible at all this! Congrats. You’re pretty unremarkable.
 The author talks about long history of time and how horrible we have been dealing with time.</description>
