今天入职LinkedIn一个月了，这一个月过的非常快，第一周培训，第二周InDay，第三周预备放假，第四周放一周假，所以事实上工作的时间远不到一个月。

Today is my so-called one month anniversary at LinkedIn. It's been a fast week, bootcamp, Inday, and a week of shutdown. So it's actually much less than a month.

这一个月最主要的任务就是熟悉公司的技术、工具、流程和自己组的产品，中间还参加了不少内部的会。虽然第一个月不太可能有多亮眼的表现，但是还是应该总结一下。

The main thing on my list this month is to get familiar with the technology, tool, process, and products in LinkedIn. Although there is not a lot of happening, I should still look back and think about what can be improved.

What I'm doing great:

- I can quickly get familiar with technology and tools in the company
- I can quickly discover issue and fix it
- I work on tasks with a plan

What I feel challenging:

- Communicate with English speakers about work and life topics is challenging
- Not being very active in meeting and participate in discussions
- Not being very active when chatting with others

I believe my situation is quite common for Chinese in U.S companies, who is active toward technology, but less active in social, and talking. If I want to make a change, I think I need to be doing these:

- Prepare for each meeting, and gain knowledge on one or two topics. This should make it easier to join discussions.
- Get prepared for some common social questions (How was your weekend, and what's your plan on weekend?)
- Encourage myself to drive discussions when a topic is completed
