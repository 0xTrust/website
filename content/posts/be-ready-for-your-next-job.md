## Part 1: My first time changing job

## Part 2: Have a goal in mind

- You should think of your next job as soon as you accept your current job offer
- When you clearly know what you want, you will be more likely to get good result.
- What is a good job?
    - Does it help you get next job
    - What if you don't know what you want, but you know what you don't want?
- If your next employer asks what you learned from your current employer?

## Part 3: Keep moving

- When you should be moving? 钱给少了，心委屈了
- Personal growth / Company growth
- Not align with career plan
- Does it have bad effect? No, job loyalty is no longer a criteria for employer.
- Stable/Listen? No! Keep moving and take risks intelligently.
- Money is not the only thing that matters when it comes to a job
- Does it make you feel confident
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
- If you don't have any preference, choose the one that pays you most

## Part 4: Career evolving

- People have different goal and interest in different phases of life. You might want to try different jobs in your entire life.
- You simply can't do the same job in your whole life
- If you are a software engineer, you know there must be a day you have to do something else
- Think about how your career might evolve
- If you are not satisfied doing basic development, but make major impact on product or industry, try management, start-ups, engineering manager
